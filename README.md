</div>

This project provides a complete workflow for fine-tuning a `bert-base-cased` model for Named Entity Recognition (NER) and deploying it as an interactive web application using Streamlit and Hugging Face.

The application identifies four types of named entities in user-provided text:
- **<font color="#ffc107">PER</font>**: Person
- **<font color="#007bff">ORG</font>**: Organization
- **<font color="#28a745">LOC</font>**: Location
- **<font color="#dc3545">MISC</font>**: Miscellaneous

## üöÄ Live Demo

A live version of this application is deployed and running on Hugging Face Spaces.

**[‚û°Ô∏è Access the Live Application Here](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Nomi78600/bert-ner-app)**

## ‚ú® Core Features

- **Interactive UI**: A clean and simple user interface powered by Streamlit for easy interaction.
- **Real-time NER**: Input any text and get immediate NER predictions from the fine-tuned BERT model.
- **Rich Entity Highlighting**: Identified entities are highlighted with color-coded labels directly in the input text for clear and intuitive visualization.
- **Extracted Entity List**: A clean list of all recognized entities and their types is displayed below the main analysis.
- **Hosted on the Hub**: The fine-tuned model is hosted on the [Hugging Face Hub](https://huggingface.co/Nomi78600/bert-ner-squad), allowing for easy integration and access.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup and Local Installation

To run this project on your local machine, please follow these steps.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Git

### Installation Steps

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    Open your terminal and clone the repository, then navigate into the project directory.
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/780Noman/NER_Using_BERT.git
    cd NER_Using_BERT
    ```

2.  **Set up a virtual environment (Recommended):**
    This isolates the project's dependencies from your system's Python installation.
    ```bash
    # Create a virtual environment
    python -m venv venv

    # Activate it
    # On Windows:
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    # On macOS/Linux:
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    The required packages are listed in `requirements.txt`.
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Run the Streamlit Application:**
    This command will start the local web server.
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```
    Your web browser should open with the application running at `http://localhost:8501`. The app will download the model from the Hugging Face Hub on its first run.

## üö¢ Deployment

This application is deployed on **Hugging Face Spaces**. The deployment workflow is configured as follows:

1.  **Model Hosting**: The fine-tuned `BertForTokenClassification` model is hosted on the [Hugging Face Hub](https://huggingface.co/Nomi78600/bert-ner-squad).
2.  **Application Code**: The Streamlit application (`app.py`) loads the model directly from the Hub repository.
3.  **Environment**: The `requirements.txt` file specifies all dependencies, which are automatically installed by the Hugging Face Spaces environment.
4.  **Continuous Deployment**: Pushing changes to the `main` branch of the Space's repository automatically triggers a new build and deployment.
